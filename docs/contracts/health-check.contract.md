# health-check — `health-check.sh` Drift-Finding Producer Contract

The seam between `scripts/health-check.sh` (the project's drift-finding producer — runs nine checks across governed documents, spec status consistency, owned-file presence, contract version pins, plan freshness, and the Strategic Anchor) and its sole downstream consumer `scripts/ci-checks.sh` (which invokes `bash scripts/health-check.sh "$ROOT"` as one block of the CI suite). One folded-in bug closes as non-recurrable: **#176** — `component-architecture-diagram.spec.md` had `status: active` + `owns: []` (a state Check 6 was implicitly tolerating); the new `governs-narrative:` field discipline encoded in HC-4 makes the conjunction a write-time contradiction (escape via explicit declaration) the smoke test pins in CI.

## Producer

`scripts/health-check.sh` — producer-type: `script`.

Runs nine numbered checks against a project directory (defaults to `pwd`, overridable via positional arg). Each check emits a `━━━ Check N: <name> ━━━` header followed by zero or more finding lines prefixed by `✓` (ok), `·` (info), or `✗` (warn). The script's exit code is `0` if no `warn` line was emitted by any check, `1` otherwise (one or more drift findings). All path resolution uses `PROJECT_DIR` (the arg or default) — never `$(pwd)` directly, never `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` — so the script is safe to invoke against a remote project tree from any working directory.

Check 7 is read-only by default; passing `--reconcile` is the only thing that mutates files (status flips from active → stale in spec frontmatter and REGISTER.md). All other checks are always read-only. Check 9 (Strategic Anchor) emits a single info line `· Skipped — roadmap.config.yaml not present` when `roadmap.config.yaml` is absent (from the wrapper at `scripts/health-check.sh:1190`), and no `✗` warn lines — so projects that haven't adopted the roadmap system see only the skipped-info line, not failures.

Check 6 (Spec status consistency) reads `status` and `owns` columns from REGISTER.md's `## Spec Index` table, then for the `status=active + owns=—` corner case opens the spec file directly to read its frontmatter `governs-narrative:` field. The branching encoded in HC-4 below is the post-#176 invariant.

## Consumer

One downstream consumer, consumer-type: `script`:

- **`scripts/ci-checks.sh`** (script). Invokes `bash scripts/health-check.sh "$ROOT"` as one block of the CI suite, currently non-blocking (`|| echo "(health-check reported issues — non-blocking)"`). The non-blocking discipline is deliberate — drift findings other than the contract-tested invariants should surface as advisory signal, not red-bar CI. The blocking enforcement comes from the contract test (`scripts/_smoke-test-contract-health-check.sh`), which runs inside `ci-checks.sh`'s blocking smoke-test loop and asserts the HC-* invariants against a fixture.

The consumer depends on the output-format stability (HC-1) and exit-code semantics (HC-2) of `health-check.sh`. Schema drift in the producer's output is the failure mode this contract pins against.

(Note: `scripts/validate-cross-refs.sh` is NOT a consumer of this seam. An earlier draft listed it, but verification confirmed it reads `docs/REGISTER.md` and spec files directly, not health-check.sh output. It's a sibling reader of REGISTER.md, governed by the register-pipeline contract — not by this contract.)

## Protocol shape

### Inputs

`scripts/health-check.sh` accepts two optional CLI arguments:

- **`--reconcile`** — flag, optional. When present, Check 7 mutates spec frontmatter and REGISTER.md (auto-flips `active → stale` for specs whose owned files were committed after the spec). Without the flag, Check 7 is read-only — drift is reported but no files are touched.
- **`[project-dir]`** — positional, defaults to `pwd`. Sets the root under which `docs/specs/`, `docs/REGISTER.md`, `contracts.yaml`, `docs/definitions/`, `.arboretum.yml`, and `roadmap.config.yaml` are resolved.

Reads (under the project-dir root):

- `docs/REGISTER.md` — Spec Index table is the primary data source for Checks 2/3/6/7.
- `docs/specs/*.spec.md` files — Check 6 opens individual spec files directly to read `governs-narrative:` for the active+empty-owns corner case; Check 7 reads `status:` for the auto-flip.
- `contracts.yaml` — Checks 4/5 consume version pins.
- `docs/definitions/*.md` — Check 5 consumes definition versions.
- `.arboretum.yml` (optional) — overrides for `status_enum:` (Check 6) and `source_paths:` (Check 3 Half B).
- `roadmap.config.yaml` (optional) — gates Check 9; absence silently skips the check.
- Plans under `docs/plans/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/` — Check 8 scans for missing Tests sections.

### Outputs

Writes to stdout (no file mutation by default; with `--reconcile`, Check 7 mutates spec frontmatter and REGISTER.md).

Output format: each check section starts with a header line `━━━ Check N: <name> ━━━` (where N is the check number, 1-9). Finding lines are prefixed by exactly one of:

- `  ✓ <message>` — ok (informational pass)
- `  · <message>` — info (non-failing observation, e.g. extended-enum acknowledgement, governs-narrative citation)
- `  ✗ <message>` — warn (drift finding; contributes to exit 1)

Exit code:

- `0` if no `warn` line was emitted by any check (clean run)
- `1` if any `warn` line was emitted (drift detected)

The `--reconcile` flag does NOT change exit-code semantics — Check 7's mutations don't suppress findings from other checks; they just clean up the active→stale drift in-place. Exit code still reflects whether any check (including the now-mutated Check 7) emitted a warn.

### Invariants

- **Output-format stability.** Each check's section begins with the `━━━ Check N: <name> ━━━` header line. Consumers parse output by check-section boundaries; reordering or renaming check headers is a producer-side schema break.
- **Exit-code contract.** Exit 0 iff no `warn` line was emitted; exit 1 otherwise. `--reconcile` does not change this — Check 7 mutations and drift findings are independent dimensions.
- **Status-enum invariant (Check 6).** Status MUST be in the configured enum (default `{draft, active, stale}` per the plugin's canonical vocabulary; configurable per-project via `.arboretum.yml status_enum:`). Unknown values: in configured projects, per-spec `warn`; in default projects, aggregate into a single post-loop `info` line (`Project uses extended status enum...`) to avoid per-spec warning floods.
- **Active-empty-owns discipline (Check 6, post-#176).** When a spec has `status: active` AND `owns` resolves to empty (empty list, `(none)`, or `—`): if the spec's frontmatter declares a non-empty `governs-narrative:` value, Check 6 emits `info` with the narrative cited (existing carve-out preserved); if `governs-narrative:` is unset or empty, Check 6 emits `warn` (contributes to exit 1) — the `active + owns:[] + no governs-narrative` conjunction is a write-time contradiction.
- **Check 7 read-only default.** Without `--reconcile`, Check 7 reports drift findings via `warn` lines but does NOT mutate any file. With `--reconcile`, Check 7 flips `active → stale` in BOTH the spec's frontmatter AND its REGISTER.md row (both surfaces must update atomically — the in-place sed editing is the implementation).
- **PROJECT_DIR isolation.** All path resolution inside the script derives from the `PROJECT_DIR` variable (positional arg or `pwd` default). The script MUST NOT call `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to discover paths — that would resolve relative to the caller's CWD instead of `PROJECT_DIR`, breaking invocations against a remote project tree. Strategic Anchor (Check 9) and all other path-derived state must be `PROJECT_DIR`-rooted.
- **Check 9 roadmap-config gating.** `roadmap.config.yaml` absent → Check 9 emits exactly one info line `· Skipped — roadmap.config.yaml not present` (from the wrapper code at `scripts/health-check.sh:1190` when `strategic_anchor_check` returns empty) and no `✗` warn lines. Present → Check 9 runs normally (verifies `## Strategic Anchor` section in CLAUDE.md, in/out scope bullets exist, review-cadence date not overdue). The gate is on file presence, not content.

## Test surface

- **HC-1: Output-format-stability.** Each invoked check's section begins with the `━━━ Check N: <name> ━━━` header. The smoke test asserts the headers for at least Checks 1, 6, 7, and 9 are present in a clean fixture run.
- **HC-2: Exit-code contract.** `bash scripts/health-check.sh <fixture>` exits 0 when the fixture has no drift; exit 1 when at least one check emits a `warn` line. Adding `--reconcile` does not change these semantics. The smoke test asserts both branches (no-drift and drift fixtures) with and without `--reconcile`.
- **HC-3: Status-enum-invariant.** A fixture spec at an unconfigured-extended-enum status (e.g. `ready`) triggers the post-loop info line `Project uses extended status enum (states observed: ...)` rather than per-spec warns. (The contract assertion covers the default-project extended-enum branch; the configured-project typo branch — `.arboretum.yml status_enum:` block present plus a typo-like status — is part of Check 6's behaviour but is not pinned by HC-3 in this contract. If a future regression of the configured-enum parser matters enough to pin, add it as a separate HC-3b assertion in a follow-up PR.)
- **HC-4: Active-owns-discipline (closes #176).** Two fixture specs both at `status: active` + `owns: []`:
  - spec-with-narrative: declares `governs-narrative: <value>` → Check 6 emits `· <spec>: status=active but owns no files (governs narrative: <value>)` AND the script's exit code is unaffected.
  - spec-without-narrative: no `governs-narrative:` field → Check 6 emits `✗ <spec>: status=active but owns no files AND no governs-narrative declared — contradiction (...)` AND the script's exit code is 1.
  The smoke test asserts both output lines AND the exit-code transition between the two fixture sub-cases.
- **HC-5: Check-7-read-only-default.** Fixture: one spec at `status: active` whose owned file has a commit timestamp newer than the spec's. Without `--reconcile`: Check 7 emits a `✗` drift finding; spec frontmatter and REGISTER.md row are byte-identical to pre-run. With `--reconcile`: same spec at `status: stale` in both the spec frontmatter and REGISTER.md row after the run. Smoke test diffs pre-/post-run state for both flag-modes.
- **HC-6: PROJECT_DIR-isolation.** Run `cd $UNRELATED_DIR && bash $FIXTURE_DIR/scripts/health-check.sh $FIXTURE_DIR` (caller's CWD differs from PROJECT_DIR). The smoke test asserts: (a) no `$UNRELATED_DIR` path string appears anywhere in stdout; (b) `$FIXTURE_DIR` paths DO appear; (c) exit code matches a same-CWD baseline run. Pins against `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` regressions in any check function.
- **HC-7: Check-9-roadmap-gating.** Two fixture projects:
  - Main fixture: no `roadmap.config.yaml` → Check 9 emits the single info line `· Skipped — roadmap.config.yaml not present` (from the wrapper at `scripts/health-check.sh:1190`) and zero `✗` warn lines. Assertion: zero `✗` lines inside the Check 9 section.
  - Mini fixture (separate `mktemp -d`): has `roadmap.config.yaml` plus a CLAUDE.md with the required `## Strategic Anchor` section, plus all Check 1 prerequisites (workflows/README.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/REGISTER.md, contracts.yaml, docs/definitions/, docs/specs/) → Check 9 emits at least one `✓` line. Assertion: Check 9 `✓` line present AND script exits 0 (no other check triggers drift).

## Versioning

- **1.0** (2026-05-27) — initial contract. Producer + consumer shapes as of `scripts/health-check.sh` post-Task-0b on `main`. Closes #176 (active+empty-owns + no governs-narrative is a contradiction) as "non-recurrable by construction" — HC-4 asserts both branches in CI; any future regression that loses the governs-narrative escape or fails to fail on the no-narrative case will red-bar the smoke test.
