# Plugin-wins policy (#394): for a managed framework file present in BOTH the tree
# and the plugin, the plugin copy always wins. A local edit is never preserved
# (no silent keep-local) and never surfaced as an edit conflict — it classifies as
# overwrite-local: applied like overwrite-safe, but named distinctly so the plan can
# flag that it discards local edits (git is the recovery net). Adopters do not fork
# framework code; only project-specific documentation stays local.
#
# Presence-mismatch (deletion) rules remain base-aware — plugin-wins governs edits,
# not deletions:
#   (a) untracked user-owned files (base empty) absent from plugin are NOT ours to
#       manage → unchanged (never falsely report-removed).
#   (b) a tracked file (base non-empty) the user intentionally deleted is respected
#       (keep-local), not silently re-added.
