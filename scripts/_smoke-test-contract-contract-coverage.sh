# _smoke-test-contract-contract-coverage.sh — Contract test for
# docs/contracts/contract-coverage.contract.md. Asserts CC-1..CC-7 from
# the contract's ## Test surface against scripts/generate-coverage.sh and
# scripts/validate-coverage-manifest.sh current behaviour.
#
# Fixture-project pattern: each case builds a mktemp -d skeleton with
# scripts/, .claude/hooks/, docs/contracts/, then runs the real coverage
# scripts against it with cwd set to the fixture root (both scripts derive
# their ROOT from $(pwd)). The scripts under test are the live ones in
# scripts/ — the fixture only supplies the surfaces they scan and the
# contracts they read.
#
# Picked up automatically by ci-checks.sh's === Smoke tests === loop.
#
# Closes #140 (arboretum should detect drift in its own artifacts) as
# non-recurrable by construction: CC-1 asserts the drift detector is
# itself covered. Any regression that drops the coverage scripts' rows or
# breaks the freshness/duplicate/ramp invariants fails this test in CI.
