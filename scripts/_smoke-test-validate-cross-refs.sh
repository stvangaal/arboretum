# _smoke-test-validate-cross-refs.sh — Exercise Check 4 (dependency
# notation consistency) in validate-cross-refs.sh.
#
# Issue stvangaal/arboretum#11: the original Check 4 parsed a "Depends On"
# column that was removed in the 4-column REGISTER schema migration.
# This restored Check 4 reads spec frontmatter `requires:` and
# `provides:` blocks and validates entry notation:
#
#   - Path-shaped entries (containing "/") must end in .md
#   - Versioned entries (containing "@") must match @v<N> exactly
#   - Bare names need no further check
#
# Usage: bash scripts/_smoke-test-validate-cross-refs.sh
# Exit 0 if all assertions pass, 1 otherwise.

Fixture spec with all well-formed dep notations, including the
versioned-path form (regression for stvangaal/arboretum#11 review
feedback). Note: example notation is in the frontmatter above; do not
write versioned-path examples in body text — Check 1's reference
scanner would treat them as real refs and look for nonexistent files.
