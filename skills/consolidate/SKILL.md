description: Reconcile a branch's code with its governance documentation across four levels — architecture, governed specs, file headers + top-of-file comments, and (opt-in) function/inline comments. Regenerates AUTO sections, preserves HUMAN sections (stale-flagging broken refs), appends harvested decisions from design specs and plans.

# Consolidate

Reconcile the branch with its governance documentation. Reconciliation covers four levels:

| Level | Surfaces | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Architecture | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PRINCIPLES.md` | Diff-driven impact prompt; user authors edits by hand. |
| 2. Governed specs | `docs/specs/*.spec.md`, `docs/REGISTER.md`, `contracts.yaml` | Full reconciliation — AUTO regen, HUMAN preserve, APPEND-AUTO decisions. |
| 3. File headers + top-of-file comments | `# owner:` lines and the comment block following them | `# owner:` rewrites are mechanical; comment-block freshness uses the level-2 stale-reference scanner. |
| 4. Function/inline comments | Comments touching changed lines in the diff | **Opt-in** via `--audit-comments`. Default proposed action per flag is *delete*, not *rewrite*. |

For each governed spec touched by this branch (level 2):

- **AUTO sections** (frontmatter, status, Tests, Implementation Notes → Design record) regenerate silently from current code, tests, and citation files.
- **HUMAN sections** (Purpose, Behaviour, free-text Implementation Notes) are preserved. v1 stale detection scans for file-path-token references that no longer exist on disk; any matches are surfaced to the user for review. (Function-name and test-case detection are deferred — see issue #108.)
- **APPEND-AUTO sections** (Decisions) accumulate new rows harvested from design specs (`docs/superpowers/specs/*-design.md`) and plans (`docs/plans/*.md`) referenced by this spec. Existing rows are never modified or removed. The Source column is the idempotency key.

When all reconciliation succeeds, the spec's status flips automatically: `draft → active` (first reconciliation) or `stale → active` (after drift). Design specs and plans are **retained as permanent historical records** — never deleted by this skill.

## Procedure

### Step 1: Detect base branch and gather changes

1. Determine the base branch:

   ```bash
   git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||' || echo "main"
   ```

2. Find the merge base:

   ```bash
   git merge-base <base-branch> HEAD
   ```

3. List all changed files on this branch:

   ```bash
   git diff --name-only <merge-base>...HEAD
   ```

4. If no changed files are found, exit early: "No changes to consolidate on this branch."

5. Categorise each changed file:

   | Category | Glob patterns | Reconciliation scope |
   |----------|--------------|----------------------|
   | Source | `src/**`, `scripts/**`, `.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md`, `skills/**/SKILL.md`, `.claude/hooks/**`, `tests/**` | Owns levels 3 and 4 |
   | Architecture-level | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PRINCIPLES.md` | Level 1 |
   | Governance outputs | `docs/specs/**`, `docs/REGISTER.md`, `docs/definitions/**`, `contracts.yaml` | Level 2 (outputs of this process) |
   | Ephemeral | `docs/plans/**`, `docs/superpowers/**` | Harvest sources for level 2 Decisions; never deleted |
   | Config/meta | `CLAUDE.md`, `.gitignore`, `settings.json`, `*.yaml` (non-contracts) | Out of scope (`CLAUDE.md` hygiene is owned by `claude-md-improver`) |

   Files not matching any pattern default to **Source** (own levels 3 and 4).

6. Present a summary to the user.

### Step 2: Identify design specs and plans for harvest

1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:
   - If `--audit-comments` is present as a token, strip it as a flag and enable level-4 auditing in step 5i.
   - The remaining non-flag token, if any, is treated as the design-spec path for harvest.
   - If multiple non-flag tokens are provided, error: "Expected at most one path argument — got: `<tokens>`."

2. Otherwise, scan `docs/superpowers/specs/*.md` for design specs and `docs/plans/*.md` for plans. Both are harvest sources for the Decisions table.

3. If governed specs being updated already cite design specs / plans in their `### Design record` subsection, those are also harvest sources (decisions accumulate over a spec's lifetime).

4. Present the list of harvest sources to the user. They are **not deleted** after harvest — they are permanent records.

### Step 3: Check existing governance state

1. Verify required template:

   ```bash
   ls docs/templates/spec.md docs/templates/register.md 2>/dev/null
   ```

   If either is missing, error: "Required template missing: `docs/templates/<name>.md`. Cannot proceed." Stop.

2. Check `docs/REGISTER.md`:
   - If yes: read it. Build a map of file → owning spec from the "Spec Index" table's "Owns" column.
   - If no: bootstrap from `docs/templates/register.md`.

3. Check `docs/specs/`:
   - If yes: read existing governed specs to understand current coverage.
   - If no: create it.

4. Cross-reference source files from Step 1 against the register map:
   - **Owned + changed** — file has a spec owner; the spec needs reconciliation. Read the owning spec.
   - **Unowned** — file has no spec owner; needs assignment to a new or existing spec.

### Step 4: Propose reconciliation plan

Present a structured reconciliation plan to the user, organised by level:

```
## Reconciliation Plan

### Bootstrapping required
- [ ] Create `docs/REGISTER.md` from template (only if absent)
- [ ] Create `docs/specs/` directory (only if absent)

### Level 1 — Architecture
<!-- Only show if any diff signals triggered the heuristic; otherwise note "No level-1 candidates flagged." -->
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — candidate edit
  - Triggered by: <e.g., new top-level skill `<name>` introduces a new entry in skill family table>
  - Lines potentially affected: <range>
  - Action: user authors edit by hand (skill does not auto-edit architecture prose)

### Level 2 — Governed specs

#### New governed specs to create
- `docs/specs/<proposed-name>.spec.md`
  - Would own: <file1>, <file2>, ...
  - Status on creation: `active` if code already exists for the listed owns, otherwise `draft`
  - Content source: harvest from `<design-spec-path>` (if provided) or code analysis only

#### Governed specs to reconcile (already exist; touched by this branch)
- `docs/specs/<existing-name>.spec.md` — owns `<changed-file>`
  - AUTO regenerate: frontmatter, Tests, Design record
  - HUMAN scan: Purpose, Behaviour, free-text Implementation Notes
  - Decisions to append: <count> new rows from design specs / plans

#### Design specs and plans to harvest decisions from
- `docs/superpowers/specs/<file>.md` (retained, not deleted)
- `docs/plans/<file>.md` (retained, not deleted)

### Level 3 — File headers + top-of-file comments

#### `# owner:` header rewrites (Path B grouping reconciliation)
<!-- Only show if final grouping differs from headers committed in source files. -->
- `<source-file>`: `# owner: <old-name>` → `# owner: <new-name>`

#### Top-of-file comment stale-flags
<!-- Only show if the stale-reference scanner flagged any comment block. -->
- `<source-file>` § top-of-file comment: stale references `<missing-refs>`
  - Action: prompt user (review now / skip / leave flagged)

### Level 4 — Function/inline comments
<!-- Only show if `--audit-comments` was passed; otherwise note "Skipped (use --audit-comments to enable)." -->
- `<source-file>:<line>` — comment: "<text>"
  - Heuristic: <removed-identifier | behaviour-changed | contradicts-surrounding-code>
  - Default action: **delete** (per project rule "default to writing no comments"). User may override.

### Files not requiring reconciliation
- <config/meta/ephemeral files>
```

When grouping files, follow `workflows/README.md ## Spec sizing`. Test files belong with the source files they test.

Wait for user approval before proceeding.

### Step 5: Execute on approval

#### 5a. Bootstrap (if needed)

If `docs/specs/` does not exist, create it. If `docs/REGISTER.md` does not exist, create it from `docs/templates/register.md`.

#### 5b. Create new governed specs

For each new spec in the approved plan:

1. Read `docs/templates/spec.md` for the structure.

2. Determine status:
   - If owned files already exist on disk and there's evidence the code matches the spec's intended behaviour (Path B post-build): `active`.
   - Otherwise (Path A pre-build, or pre-implementation draft): `draft`.

3. Populate sections:
   - **Purpose** — if a design spec is provided, harvest from its problem statement. Otherwise stub: `<!-- HUMAN — Why does this exist? -->`
   - **Behaviour** — if a design spec is provided, harvest from its deliverable spec / procedure. Otherwise stub: `<!-- HUMAN — What should the system do? -->` Per the collaborative authoring model, do NOT generate Behaviour from code in code-analysis-only mode.
   - **Tests** (AUTO) — list each test file under owns by name with tier; declare "N/A — [reason]" for inapplicable tiers.
   - **Implementation Notes → Design record** (AUTO) — citation list of design specs and plans referenced by this spec.
   - **Decisions** (APPEND-AUTO) — initial row(s) harvested from referenced design specs / plans (see Decision harvest below).

4. Present the drafted spec to the user. Wait for approval before writing.

5. Write the spec to `docs/specs/<name>.spec.md`.

#### 5c. Reconcile existing governed specs (regeneration)

For each existing spec touched by this branch:

1. Read the current spec.

2. **Regenerate AUTO sections** silently:
   - Frontmatter (name, owner, owns) — recompute from REGISTER and current code.
   - Status — see Step 5e (auto-flip rules below).
   - Tests — re-derive from current test files.
   - Implementation Notes → Design record — rebuild citation list from referenced design specs and plans.

3. **Scan HUMAN sections** (Purpose, Behaviour, free-text Implementation Notes) for stale references. See "Stale reference detection" below. For each section that has stale flags, prompt the user.

4. **Harvest decisions** from referenced design specs and plans into the Decisions table. See "Decision harvest" below.

5. Present diff of all changes to the user. Wait for approval before writing.

#### 5d. Update REGISTER.md

1. Add/update entries for each new or reconciled spec in the "Spec Index" table.
2. Update the "Definitions Index" if new specs reference definitions.
3. Update the "Dependency Resolution Order" if dependencies changed.

#### 5e. Auto-flip status

Per the simplified state machine (`draft / active / stale`):

- A spec at `draft` whose reconciliation succeeded with code present → flip to `active`.
- A spec at `stale` whose reconciliation resolved the drift → flip to `active`.
- A spec at `active` with no detected drift → leave at `active` (no-op).
- A spec at `draft` with no code yet → leave at `draft` (no-op).

No prompts. The flip happens automatically as part of writing the reconciled spec.

#### 5f. Update contracts.yaml

If `contracts.yaml` exists and new specs reference shared definitions, add version pins. Otherwise skip.

#### 5g. Level 3 — File headers + top-of-file comments

For each changed source file:

1. **`# owner:` header rewriting** (Path B grouping reconciliation): if the approved reconciliation plan included header rewrites (because final grouping differs from what files committed to):
   - Edit the first comment line in place (`# owner: <new-name>`).
   - Update the corresponding `Owns` cell in REGISTER.md (already done in 5d, but verify).

2. **Top-of-file comment audit**: run the stale-reference scanner (see "Stale reference detection" below) over the comment block immediately after `# owner:`. For each flagged comment block:
   - Print: "Stale references in `<source-file>` § top-of-file comment: `<missing-refs>`"
   - Prompt: "Review the section now? (y / n / skip)"
   - On `y`: present the comment for inline edit.
   - On `n` / `skip`: leave unchanged but record the flag for the consolidation summary.

#### 5h. Level 1 — Architecture impact prompt

For each changed source file in this branch, apply diff-driven heuristics to detect candidates whose changes may have altered system shape. Heuristics include:

- New top-level skill (new directory under `skills/`).
- New external dependency (additions to package manifests, new imports of third-party libraries).
- New public surface (new exported function in a level-2 spec's Provides table).
- Edits to files cited by `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` or `PRINCIPLES.md`.

For each triggered heuristic:

- Print: "Possible architecture impact: `<source-file>` (`<heuristic>`). Affected target: `<docs/ARCHITECTURE.md | PRINCIPLES.md>`"
- Prompt: "Review the target now? (y / n / skip)"
- On `y`: open the target file and surface the relevant section for the user to edit. The skill does not auto-edit architecture-level prose.
- On `n` / `skip`: leave unchanged but record the flag for the consolidation summary.

If `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` or `PRINCIPLES.md` is absent: skip silently — never auto-create.

#### 5i. Level 4 — Function/inline comment audit (opt-in)

Skip this substep unless the user passed `--audit-comments` as an argument to `/consolidate`.

When enabled, scan the diff for comments touching changed lines:

```bash
git diff <merge-base>...HEAD -- <source-file>
```

Apply heuristics to flag likely-stale comments:

- Comments referencing removed identifiers (function/variable names in the comment that no longer exist in the file).
- Comments describing behaviour that changed (compare adjacent code lines pre- and post-diff).
- Comments contradicting surrounding code (e.g., comment says "returns null on error" but adjacent code now throws).

For each flag:

- Print: "Possibly stale comment in `<source-file>:<line>`: `<comment-text>` — heuristic: `<which-one>`"
- Default proposed action: **delete**, per the project rule "default to writing no comments." User may override per item.
- Prompt: "Apply default (delete)? (y / edit / skip)"
- On `y`: delete the comment.
- On `edit`: present the comment for inline edit.
- On `skip`: leave unchanged but record the flag for the consolidation summary.

This substep never adds new comments. The bias is toward removing stale ones.

### Step 6: Verify

1. Run `scripts/health-check.sh`.
2. Present results.
3. Summarise what was done:

   ```
   ## Consolidation Complete

   ### Level 1 — Architecture
   - <ARCHITECTURE.md / PRINCIPLES.md edits applied or flagged for review, or "no candidates flagged">

   ### Level 2 — Governed specs

   #### Created
   - <new spec files>
   - <REGISTER.md if bootstrapped>

   #### Reconciled
   - <spec> — AUTO regenerated; HUMAN unchanged; <N> decisions appended; status: <new>
   - <spec> — AUTO regenerated; <N> HUMAN sections stale-flagged; status: <new>

   #### Retained (no deletion)
   - <design specs and plans referenced>

   ### Level 3 — File headers + top-of-file comments
   - `# owner:` rewrites: <files, or "none">
   - Top-of-file comment edits: <files, or "none">

   ### Level 4 — Function/inline comments
   - <comment edits applied, only if --audit-comments was passed; else "skipped (use --audit-comments to enable)">

   ### Health Check
   <pass/fail summary>
   ```

## Regeneration model

Governed specs (level 2) are regenerated on each pass to reflect current code, while preserving human-authored content and accumulating decision history. The same AUTO/HUMAN/APPEND-AUTO vocabulary now extends to surfaces beyond the governed spec: `# owner:` lines (level 3) are AUTO; top-of-file source comments and `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `PRINCIPLES.md` prose are HUMAN.

Sections are classified by authorship:

- **AUTO** — frontmatter, status, Tests, Implementation Notes → Design record subsection (level 2); `# owner:` lines (level 3). Regenerated silently from current code/tests/citations on every pass.
- **HUMAN** — Purpose, Behaviour, free-text Implementation Notes (level 2); top-of-file source comments (level 3); `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` / `PRINCIPLES.md` prose (level 1). Never overwritten by the skill. Scanned for stale references where applicable; flagged matches prompt the user.
- **APPEND-AUTO** — Decisions (level 2 only). New rows harvested from design specs and plans referenced by this spec. Existing rows are never modified or removed. The Source column is the idempotency key — `/consolidate` does not re-add a decision whose source artifact + decision ID is already cited.

## Stale reference detection

The same scanner applies to any text region classified as HUMAN that may cite file paths: governed-spec HUMAN sections (level 2) and top-of-file source comments (level 3).

For each region being scanned:

1. Extract candidate references via regex:
   - Backtick-wrapped paths: `` `docs/foo.md` `` matches `docs/foo.md`.
   - Naked path tokens matching `(\.?\w[\w./-]*\.\w+)`.
2. For each candidate, check `[ -e "$candidate" ]` (file exists).
3. If any references are missing, the region is "stale-flagged":
   - Print: "Stale references in `<file>` § `<region-name>`: `<missing-refs>`"
   - Prompt: "Review the region now? (y / n / skip)"
   - On `y`: present the region for inline edit.
   - On `n` / `skip`: leave unchanged but record the flag for the consolidation summary.

Function-name and test-case stale detection is out of scope for v1 (see issue tracker for the richer guided-reconciliation flow). Level-4 comment heuristics are documented in 5i.

## Decision harvest from design specs and plans

For each design spec or plan referenced in the spec's `### Design record` subsection:

1. Read the file.
2. Extract decision-shaped content: tables with "Decision" / "Alternatives" columns, or numbered "Decision summary" lists.
3. For each decision found, check whether a matching row already exists in the spec's Decisions table — match by `Source artifact path + decision ID`.
4. If no match, append a new row with `Source = "<artifact-path> (decision <ID>)"`.

Idempotency: re-running `/consolidate` with no new design specs / plans produces zero new rows.

## Important Notes

- **Never auto-commit.** All changes to governed documents require user approval before writing to disk. Present drafts and proposed edits, then wait for confirmation.
- **Design specs and plans are permanent records.** Never delete them. They are cited from the governed spec's Design record subsection and harvested for decisions.
- **Respect collaborative authoring.** When harvesting from design specs, transplant human-authored content. When no design spec exists, stub Behaviour for the human to write — do not generate it from code. Level-1 architecture prose is never auto-edited by this skill; the skill surfaces candidates and the user authors edits.
- **Level 4 is opt-in and delete-biased.** `--audit-comments` enables function/inline comment auditing. The default proposed action per flag is *delete*, never *write*, per the project rule "default to writing no comments." This substep never adds new comments.
- **Status auto-flips.** No "promote to active" prompts. `draft → active` (or `stale → active`) happens automatically when reconciliation succeeds. The human's commitment moment is the act of running `/consolidate`.
- **Idempotency.** Running this skill twice with no intervening code or harvest changes produces no diff. AUTO sections regenerate to the same content; HUMAN sections are unchanged; the Decisions table is unchanged because the Source column dedups already-cited decisions.
