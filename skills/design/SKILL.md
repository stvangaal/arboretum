# Design

Orchestrates the transition from idea to implementable governed spec. This is a wrapper that coordinates external design skills with arboretum's governance.

## When to use

- Starting planned work (user knows what they want to build)
- After `/start` routes to the planned path
- When the user says "let's design this" or "let's spec this out"

## Procedure

### Step 0: Read the pipeline.workflow flag

Before any path-selection logic, read the active pipeline version:

```bash
PIPELINE=$(bash scripts/read-pipeline-flag.sh)
```

- **`v1` (default)** — continue with Step 0-v1 below (Path A/B selection, then the existing Steps 1-4). Skip Section v2.
- **`v2`** — skip Step 0-v1 and Steps 1-4 entirely. Jump to **Section v2: Unified design phase** below — it replaces the v1 procedure.

### Step 0-v1: Determine path — A or B? (when `PIPELINE=v1`)

Skip this section when `PIPELINE=v2`. Under v2, jump to **Section v2: Unified design phase** below.


Ask the user (or determine from context) which governance path applies:

- **Path A (spec-first):** the user knows what they want to build. Output is the governed spec at `docs/specs/<topic>.spec.md`, status `draft`. After approval the workflow goes to `/consolidate` (which here just creates the governed spec from the design discussion), then plan, then build.
- **Path B (design-first):** the user is exploring or the design is still emerging. Output is the design spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`. The governed spec is created later by `/consolidate` after build.

The handoffs differ:
- **Path A handoff:** design discussion → `/consolidate` to create governed spec at status `draft` → plan → build → `/consolidate` (regenerate; status flips to `active`) → `/finish`.
- **Path B handoff:** design spec written → plan → build → `/consolidate` (creates governed spec at name = design topic, status `active`) → `/finish`.

Default to Path A unless the user explicitly says they want to explore.

### Step 1: Check for existing design work (v1 only — skip under v2)

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, treat it as a path to an existing superpowers design spec:
1. Read the file
2. Confirm with the user: "Found design spec at `<path>`. Consolidate this into a governed spec?"
3. If confirmed, skip to Step 3 (consolidate).

Otherwise, check for unconsolidated design specs:
```bash
ls docs/superpowers/specs/*.md 2>/dev/null
```

If any exist, present them:
> "Found existing design specs:
> 1. `docs/superpowers/specs/<file1>.md` — <first heading>
> 2. `docs/superpowers/specs/<file2>.md` — <first heading>
>
> Consolidate one of these, or start a new design?"

### Step 1b: Survey existing specs (v1 only — skip under v2)

Before starting the brainstorming phase, read existing specs in `docs/specs/` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to surface governed code that may be relevant to the design topic. This prevents designing something that overlaps with existing work.

### Step 2: Brainstorm (v1 only — skip under v2)

If no existing design spec is being used, initiate the brainstorming process. This step wraps the external brainstorm capability with three responsibilities — *brief*, *capture user contributions*, *verify* — per `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md ## Wrapped delegation pattern`.

#### 2a. Brief

Before invoking brainstorming, gather the project context the external skill cannot infer:

- **Spec structure** — read `docs/templates/spec.md` so the design spec's structure aligns with what `/consolidate` will later harvest from.
- **Related governed specs** — list specs from `docs/specs/` that touch the topic; brainstorming should read these to avoid duplicating existing behaviour.
- **Naming and path conventions** — Path B output goes to `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`; Path A consolidates to `docs/specs/<topic>.spec.md`.
- **Path-aware exit** — tell brainstorming the chosen path so its output is named/located accordingly.

Hand these to brainstorming as a structured prompt. The brief turns generic-correct brainstorming into project-correct brainstorming.

#### 2b. Capture user contributions

Before brainstorming starts, ask the user (via `AskUserQuestion`) for domain knowledge brainstorming cannot infer from the codebase:

> "Before brainstorming, are there domain constraints, stakeholders, or known unknowns I should hand over? For example: regulatory rules that scope behaviour, downstream consumers that lock interfaces, prior approaches that didn't work."

Capture the response and include it in the brief. If the user has nothing to add, proceed.

#### 2c. Invoke brainstorming

Invoke the **brainstorm** capability (currently provided by `superpowers:brainstorming`) with the brief plus user contributions. If the provider is not available, conduct the design conversation directly using the same brief.

The brainstorm process will:
- Ask clarifying questions (informed by the brief and user contributions)
- Propose approaches
- Present a design for approval
- Write a design spec to the path specified in the brief

#### 2d. Verify output

After brainstorming returns, before exiting Step 2:

- **Path check** — design spec landed at the expected location (Path A → `docs/specs/...`, Path B → `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`).
- **Structure check** — required sections present (Purpose, Behaviour, key decisions). Path A specs follow the spec template; Path B design specs follow superpowers' design-spec format.
- **Contribution check** — if the user supplied domain constraints in 2b, confirm they are reflected in the design spec (either as Behaviour clauses, decisions, or open questions).

If any check fails, surface the gap to the user and offer to amend before continuing.

#### 2e. Path-aware exit

When verification passes:
- **Path B (design-first):** the design spec is the output. Exit to planning — `/consolidate` will run later at `/finish` and produce the governed spec from built state. Do not call `/consolidate` here.
- **Path A (spec-first):** consolidate the design spec into the governed spec now (Step 3) so it can be reviewed before planning. The governed spec lands at status `draft`.

### Step 3: Consolidate into governed spec (v1 only — skip under v2)

Run `/consolidate` with the design spec path:

1. Invoke the consolidate skill, pointing it at the design spec produced in Step 2 (or provided via `$ARGUMENTS`).
2. The consolidate skill will:
   - Harvest content from the design spec
   - Create or update governed specs in `docs/specs/`
   - Update the register
   - Set status based on workflow stage: Path A pre-build consolidation creates the governed spec at `draft` (no code yet); Path B post-build reconciliation against existing code auto-flips `draft → active` when consolidation succeeds (no separate promotion step)
   - **Retain** the design spec — it is a permanent historical record

3. After consolidation completes, confirm the result:
> "Governed spec created: `docs/specs/<name>.spec.md` (status: `draft` for Path A pre-build, or `active` for Path B post-build).
> Ready to plan the implementation?"

### Step 4: Transition to planning (v1 only — skip under v2)

Once the governed spec exists (Path A) or the design spec is approved (Path B), invoke the plan capability with the same brief / contribute / verify wrapping.

#### 4a. Brief

Hand the plan capability the project context it needs:

- **Workflow stage map** — read `workflows/feature.md` (or the active workflow). The plan must respect Build → `/finish` → `/consolidate` → `/cleanup`, not assume the spec is `active` before code is written. Path B plans in particular must understand that the governed spec is *born* at `/finish`, not pre-build.
- **Test taxonomy** — `CLAUDE.md ## Testing` defines the project's tiers (unit, contract, integration, domain). Plan steps should pair code work with the appropriate test tier.
- **Consolidate-last lifecycle** — the plan should not include a "promote spec to active" step; that flips automatically.
- **Plan location** — arboretum plans live in `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` (per `CLAUDE.md` package structure). State this explicitly when invoking the plan capability: `superpowers:writing-plans` otherwise defaults to `docs/superpowers/plans/`, which is not arboretum's convention.

#### 4b. Capture user contributions

Ask the user:

> "Before I plan: are there checkpoints where you want me to pause for review? For example: after the riskiest step, after the first end-to-end pass, before any irreversible operation."

Include the response in the brief.

#### 4c. Invoke plan capability

Suggest: "The spec is ready. Want to create an implementation plan?"

If yes, invoke the **plan** capability (currently provided by `superpowers:writing-plans`), using the governed spec as input — not the design spec — plus the brief and user contributions. If the provider is not available, create the plan directly following the project's plan template.

#### 4d. Verify output

After the plan returns:

- **Tier match** — each plan step has test expectations naming the appropriate tier from the project's taxonomy.
- **Checkpoint match** — if the user supplied review checkpoints in 4b, the plan includes them as explicit pause points.
- **Lifecycle match** — the plan ends at "create PR via `/finish`" and does not pre-flip spec status.
- **Location match** — the plan was written to `docs/plans/`, not the `superpowers:writing-plans` default `docs/superpowers/plans/`. If it landed in the wrong place, move it.

If any check fails, ask the plan capability to amend (or amend directly).

## Section v2: Unified design phase (when `PIPELINE=v2`)

Skip this section when `PIPELINE=v1`. When `PIPELINE=v2`, replace Steps 0-v1, 1, 1b, 2, 3, 4 above with the procedure here.

Under v2, the Path A vs Path B distinction is gone: every everything-else change produces an **ephemeral design spec** (WS2 D3, D4), the governed spec is born from built state at `/finish` (D3), and planning folds in to this skill (D4 + Touched-assets row in the WS2 design).

`$ARGUMENTS` arrives from `/start` in the form `Issue #<N>: <change request text>`.

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for the issue number and the request text — the issue number populates `related-issue` in v2.5's S2 frontmatter (`/build`'s strict gate requires a positive integer). If `$ARGUMENTS` is `Issue #pending: <request>`, prompt the user to create the GitHub issue before writing the design spec (use `gh issue create` per the project's standard issue templates) and substitute the new issue number.

Note: under v2, `$ARGUMENTS` carries change-request text plus an issue prefix, not a spec path. (Under v1, `$ARGUMENTS` is a spec path per the existing Step 1.)

### v2.1 SURVEY

Before any design work, read existing governed code that may be relevant to the topic:

1. List `docs/specs/` and read any spec whose name plausibly overlaps the request topic — don't infer from filenames alone.
2. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — scan the section relevant to the request area.
3. Read `docs/REGISTER.md` — identify the owning spec for any files the request mentions explicitly.

Under v2, SURVEY is owned exclusively by this skill — `/start` skips its Step 2b survey when `PIPELINE=v2` (see `/start` Step 2b's v2-skip note). This keeps the survey single-owner; the v1 split (`/start` does Step 2b, `/design` Step 1b repeats it) becomes one read in `/design`.

### v2.2 Triage change kind → Branch 1 mode (WS2 D5)

Branch 1 has four modes; each converges on a design spec but the dialogue shape differs. Ask the user (via `AskUserQuestion`) which mode fits, with the default inferred from the request type:

| Request type | Branch 1 mode | Provider skill |
|---|---|---|
| New or changed behaviour | **brainstorm** | `superpowers:brainstorming` |
| Bug fix | **investigate** | `superpowers:systematic-debugging` |
| Refactor (behaviour preserved) | **coverage-baseline** | (no external skill — establish/verify test coverage first; no behaviour brainstorm) |
| Well-defined or docs-only | **none** | (no dialogue — author a thin design spec directly) |

**Precedence on ambiguity:** present the inferred default and offer the other three as alternatives. If the user picks **none** for a change that isn't trivially well-defined, push back once and confirm — "none" skips the design dialogue entirely; misusing it for a non-trivial change loses the value of Branch 1.

### v2.3 Dispatch Branch 1

Invoke the mode's provider skill (if any) with a brief that includes:

- The user's original request (from `$ARGUMENTS`)
- The SURVEY output (relevant governed specs, architecture excerpts)
- Naming convention: design spec lands at `docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`
- Template: for modes where this skill authors the spec directly (investigate, coverage-baseline, none), use `docs/templates/spec.md` as the structural skeleton so `/consolidate` at `/finish` can harvest from it correctly

For **brainstorm** mode, the provider's output is the design spec. For **investigate** mode, the provider's output is a structured root-cause analysis; transcribe it into the design spec template. For **coverage-baseline** mode, run the project's test suite, identify coverage gaps in the refactor's blast radius, and document them in the design spec's Behaviour section as "tests to add before the refactor begins". For **none** mode, author the design spec directly from the request — Purpose + Behaviour + a single "decision: change is trivially well-defined, no Branch 1 dialogue needed" entry.

All four modes produce a design spec at the conventional path. The spec is mandatory under v2 — never skip it (D4: "the everything-else pre-build **always** produces an ephemeral design spec").

### v2.4 Plan fold-in (invoke `superpowers:writing-plans` internally)

Under v2, planning is part of `/design`, not a separate step. After the design spec is written, invoke `superpowers:writing-plans` with a brief that includes:

- The design spec path (the writing-plans skill will read it)
- Project plan convention: `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` (NOT the writing-plans default `docs/superpowers/plans/`)
- Test taxonomy from `CLAUDE.md ## Testing`
- Workflow stage: under v2, plans end at `/finish`; no "promote spec to active" step (status flips automatically at `/consolidate`)

After writing-plans returns, verify the plan landed at `docs/plans/`, not `docs/superpowers/plans/`. If it landed in the wrong place, move it with `git mv` (preserves history) and update the `plan:` field in the design spec frontmatter to match the new path — `/build` reads that field, and a stale `plan:` pointer causes a "plan path not found" error.

### v2.5 Exit to `/build`

Both the design spec and the plan now exist. Hand off to `/build` with the design spec path:

```
/build docs/superpowers/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md
```

`/build` reads the S2 frontmatter on the design spec and dispatches accordingly. The design spec author (this skill, in v2.3 / v2.4) is responsible for populating ALL five required fields — `/build`'s gate is strict and rejects any missing field. Use this schema (from WS1 D3):

```yaml
related-issue: <N>
triage: everything-else          # agent-target | everything-else
implementation-mode: direct      # direct | executing-plans | subagent-driven-development
plan: docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md   # relative path | null
test-tiers:
  unit: yes                      # yes | n/a — <reason>
  contract: n/a — no shared definitions touched
  integration: yes
```

Do not auto-invoke `/build`. The user (or the calling skill) drives the next stage.

## Important

- This skill is the **conductor** for the design phase. It doesn't replace brainstorming — it ensures the output lands in the right place (governed specs, not just design docs).
- The critical value is the **path-aware exit**. On Path A the wrapper consolidates into a governed spec for review before planning; on Path B it exits to planning with the design spec as the in-flight authority (the governed spec is born at `/finish`). Both paths are gate-compliant — the spec-first gate accepts either a governed spec (`draft`/`active`) or a design spec for the topic.
- If the user wants to skip brainstorming and write a spec directly, they can create one from `docs/templates/spec.md`.
- If the user is on the exploratory path and has already explored, skip brainstorming — go straight to consolidation (Step 3).
