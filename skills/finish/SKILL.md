# Finish

Guides the transition from "code is done" to "PR is created." Orchestrates verification, spec promotion, and PR creation in the right order.

## When to use

- Implementation is complete
- User says "I think we're done", "create a PR", "let's wrap up"
- After the implement → commit loop is finished

## Procedure

### Step 0: Read the pipeline.workflow flag from the project root

Before any other step, resolve the active worktree root:

```bash
PROJECT_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || printf '%s\n' "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$PWD}")"
```

Then read the active pipeline version from that root:

```bash
PIPELINE="$(cd "$PROJECT_DIR" && bash "$PROJECT_DIR/scripts/read-pipeline-flag.sh")"
```

Also read the configured repo backend from the same root so the ship tail can use
the correct PR provider:

```bash
source "$PROJECT_DIR/scripts/roadmap/lib.sh"
SHIP_BACKEND="$(roadmap_backend "$PROJECT_DIR")"
export SHIP_BACKEND
```

- **`v1` (default)** — continue with Steps 1–7 below as written.
- **`v2`** — **read Section v2: Ship-tail under the unified workflow FIRST**, then run Steps 1–7 with the v2 amendments it specifies (most importantly: Step 5 `/security-review` is **mandatory** under v2, not optional). The procedural shape is identical to v1 — there is no Path A vs B branching to suppress — but the v2 amendments must be applied at the moment each step runs, not retroactively.

### Step 1: Verify implementation state

**Routing on `/build`'s exit-status (S3-8).** Before any other verification, read the most recent `/build exited` journey-log entry on the active issue and route on its `exit-status:` value. Until `scripts/get-latest-stage-log.sh` ships (WS9 follow-up), this is a descriptive routing — the operator confirms which path `/build` exited on:

When `exit-status: success` is the most recent `/build exited` value, continue the ship tail below (verify → consolidate → security-review → ship → PR).

When `exit-status: escape-hatch` is the most recent `/build exited` value, return to `/design` with the design spec as the in-flight authority. Halt — do not invoke `/pr` or any later stage. The escape-hatch outcome means the build surfaced a design decision that requires returning to `/design`.

At entry, if `$ISSUE` is set, log the stage:

```bash
if [ -n "${ISSUE:-}" ]; then
  bash scripts/log-stage.sh "$ISSUE" /finish entered
fi
```

Check the current state:

```bash
git status --short
git log $(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||' || echo main)..HEAD --oneline
```

Report:
- **Uncommitted changes:** If any, warn: "You have uncommitted changes. Commit them first?"
- **Commits on branch:** List them so the user can confirm the work is complete
- **Current branch:** Confirm it's a feature branch

If there are uncommitted changes, wait for the user to resolve them before proceeding.

### Step 2: Identify affected specs

If `docs/REGISTER.md` exists:

1. Get all changed files on this branch:
   ```bash
   BASE=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's|refs/remotes/origin/||' || echo main)
   git diff $BASE...HEAD --name-only
   ```

2. Read the register and map changed files to owning specs
3. Read each owning spec and check its status

Present:
```
## Specs affected by this branch

| Spec | Current Status | Action needed |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| <name> | draft | Run `/consolidate` to reconcile to `active` |
| <name> | stale | Run `/consolidate` to reconcile drift |
| <name> | active | OK — no action needed |
```

If any specs are still `draft` or `stale`, flag this — they should be at `active` before creating a PR. `/consolidate` reconciles `draft → active` (or `stale → active`).

### Step 3: Run health check

If `scripts/health-check.sh` exists:

```bash
bash scripts/health-check.sh "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" 2>&1
```

Present results. If issues are found:
> "Health check found issues. Fix these before creating the PR? Or proceed anyway?"

### Step 4: Reconcile specs to `active` via `/consolidate`

For each spec affected by this branch, ensure its status is `active` (matches current code). Under the simplified state machine, status flips happen automatically:

- `/consolidate` flips `draft` → `active` when reconciliation succeeds.
- `/health-check` flips `active` → `stale` when drift is detected.

**If any affected spec is at `draft` or `stale`**, automatically invoke `/consolidate` to reconcile. `/consolidate` will run its normal interactive flow (presenting reconciliation plans for approval, regenerating AUTO sections, harvesting decisions). Don't ask the user whether to run it — running `/consolidate` is the mechanism by which `/finish` honors its name.

If all affected specs are already at `active`, this step is a no-op (skip silently).

Skip this step entirely for documentation-only changes (no source files in the diff).

### Step 5: Security review

Check if any changed files are agent-facing:
- `.claude/hooks/**`, `.claude/skills/**`, `skills/**`, `.githooks/**`, `scripts/**`
- `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`

**Under `PIPELINE=v1`** — if any match, prompt: "This branch modifies agent-facing code. Run `/security-review` before creating the PR? (Recommended but not required)". If the user agrees, run the security review. If they decline, proceed.

**Under `PIPELINE=v2`** — `/security-review` is **mandatory** per WS2 D7 (B4 ship-tail step). Always invoke it, regardless of whether agent-facing files appear in the diff. The skill self-gates and exits fast when no injection surface is present, so the cost is near zero on changes that genuinely need nothing.

### Step 5.5: Pre-PR local CI gate

Determine the local check command from the project's declared testing shape,
falling back to `/finish`'s **current** behaviour — run `ci-checks.sh` if present,
else skip (this consumer does **not** add `package.json`/`Makefile` discovery; that
would change today's `/finish` behaviour — see the `/finish` carve-out in
`docs/contracts/test-infrastructure.contract.md`):

```bash
TEST_SPEC="docs/specs/test-infrastructure.spec.md"
RTC_ERR=$(mktemp)
if CFG=$(bash scripts/read-test-config.sh "$TEST_SPEC" 2>"$RTC_ERR"); then
  TEST_CMD=$(printf '%s\n' "$CFG" | grep -m1 '^default-command=' | cut -d= -f2-)
else
  # Present-but-invalid (exit 2) warns; absent (exit 1) is silent.
  [ -f "$TEST_SPEC" ] && echo "WARNING: $TEST_SPEC is present but invalid ($(cat "$RTC_ERR")); falling back — fix the declaration." >&2
  if [ -f scripts/ci-checks.sh ]; then TEST_CMD="bash scripts/ci-checks.sh"; else TEST_CMD=""; fi
fi
rm -f "$RTC_ERR"

if [ -n "$TEST_CMD" ]; then
  eval "$TEST_CMD"
else
  echo "no declared default-command and no scripts/ci-checks.sh — skipping pre-PR gate"
fi
```

Run **only** `default-command` — never the `opt-in-commands` tiers. If it exits
non-zero, present the failures and fix them before proceeding — the PR should be
green from its first push.

### Step 6: Create PR

Invoke the `/pr` skill to create the pull request through `$SHIP_BACKEND`. It handles:
- Health check summary
- Spec context
- Pushing the branch
- Creating the PR via `gh pr create` for `github`
- Creating the PR via `az repos pr create` for `azure-devops`

Present the PR URL when done.

### Step 6.3: Hand off to `/land`

After the PR is created, invoke `/land <pr-number>` to drive it to merge-ready
through the same backend. For `github`, `/land` runs the existing CI/reviewer
poll loop. For `azure-devops`, `/land` uses Azure Repos state and policy checks
and hands off any unsupported reviewer-thread automation explicitly. `/land`
runs its own asynchronous loop where supported; `/finish` does not block on it.

### Step 7: Suggest next steps

After the PR is created:
> "PR created: <url>
>
> After it's approved and merged, run `/cleanup` to switch to main, pull, and delete this branch. The ship tail is `/cleanup` → `/reflect` → `/handoff`; `/reflect` Q5 is the canonical handoff invocation (queues `next-up` against an issue that is actually-open post-merge)."

At exit, if `$ISSUE` is set, log:

```bash
if [ -n "${ISSUE:-}" ]; then
  bash scripts/log-stage.sh "$ISSUE" /finish exited
fi
```

## Section v2: Ship-tail under the unified workflow (when `PIPELINE=v2`)

Under v2 (`pipeline.workflow: v2` in `roadmap.config.yaml`), the procedure above is **unchanged** — `/finish` never branched on Path A vs Path B in v1, so there is no Path A/B prose to suppress. The v2 ship tail is the same sequence: verify → identify affected specs → health-check → `/consolidate` → `/security-review` → `ci-checks` → backend-aware `/pr` → backend-aware `/land`.

The model-level differences that v2 introduces (governed specs are written **only** by `/consolidate` per WS2 D3; the everything-else pre-build **always** produces an ephemeral design spec per D4) are upstream of `/finish` — they change what `/consolidate` does in Step 4, not what `/finish` orchestrates. Under v2:

- Step 2's "specs affected by this branch" list will, for everything-else changes, always include the design spec at `docs/superpowers/specs/`; that spec drives `/consolidate`'s behaviour but is not itself a governed spec.
- Step 4's `/consolidate` invocation is the **sole writer** of `docs/specs/*.spec.md` under v2 (per D3). The "If any affected spec is at `draft` or `stale`" check still applies — `/consolidate` flips `draft → active` when reconciliation succeeds.
- Step 5's security review is **mandatory** under the unified workflow (WS2 D7, B4) — invoke `/security-review` rather than offering it optionally. The skill self-gates and exits fast when no injection surface is present.

These adjustments are documented here for the v2 reader; the procedure steps above remain authoritative and require no edit.

## Important

- This skill orchestrates existing skills (`/consolidate`, `/security-review`, `/pr`, `/land`). It doesn't duplicate their internals — it calls them in the right order.
- **`/handoff` is no longer invoked here** (WS1 D8). The pre-merge handoff in the prior Step 6.5 queued `next-up` against the issue the PR was about to close — a race that resolved incoherently. Handoff now fires post-merge from `/reflect` Q5, which is the single canonical handoff invocation in the ship tail.
- Steps are sequential and each depends on the previous one. Don't skip ahead.
- If the user wants to create a PR without reconciling spec status via `/consolidate` or running health checks, let them — this is guidance, not a gate. But note what was skipped.
- For documentation-only branches (no source code changes), there is typically no spec-status reconciliation needed; skip security review and go straight to health check and PR.
